# 14. Define two variables, j and k, with values 37 and 52 respectively.
# a) What is the sum of `j` and `k`?
# b) Now re-assign `j` and `k` to have the vales 8 and 3 respectively. Re-use
# your code from the editor to determine their sum and product.

j = 37
k = 52

sum = j + k

j = 8
k = 3

print("j:",j)
print("k:", k)
